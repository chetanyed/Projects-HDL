# APB Protocol Verification (UVM)

This project verifies an AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) slave interface using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) in SystemVerilog. The testbench performs protocol compliance checks, constrained-random stimulus generation, and functional coverage analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Features

- âœ… APB v2.0 slave interface verification
- âœ… UVM-based modular testbench architecture
- âœ… Constrained-random and directed stimulus
- âœ… Monitor, scoreboard, coverage collector
- âœ… Functional coverage with 100% goal achievement
- âœ… Self-checking testbench with detailed reporting
