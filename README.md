## Introduction

This repository includes a collection of Verilog HDL projects that I have worked on. Each project demonstrates a specific aspect of digital design, ranging from simple combinational circuits to more complex sequential systems. Verilog is a powerful language used for describing digital systems and is widely used in FPGA and ASIC design.

## Projects

1. **RISC-V Processor**
   - Description: An implementation of a RISC-V processor, a versatile and modular open-source processor architecture.
   - Features:
   - Implementation of the RV32I Instructions in both the single cycle and Pipelined CPU core.
   - Forwarding/Bypassing for Raw Data hazards and Stalling and Flushing Pipeline stages for Branch hazards

2. **Asynchronous FIFO**
   - Description: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory buffer that handles asynchronous read and write operations.
   - Features:- Configurable depth and width, status flags, and clock domain crossing.

3. **SHA-256**
   - Description: An implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function, which is widely used in security applications.
   - Features: Supports 256-bit hash computation, message padding, and processing.
  
## Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chetanyed/Projects-HDL.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and follow the instructions 

## Usage

Each project comes with its own testbench and can be simulated with Icarus Verilog and Gtkwave

Here are the cmd line prompts:
```bash
iverilog -o <file_name>.vvp <testbench_file>.v
vvp <file_name>.vvp
gtkwave <vcd_file>.vcd
```
